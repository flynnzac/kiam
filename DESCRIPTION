Description: KIAM (Keep it a Matrix) keeps matrices matrices and preserves their dimension when you subset them so that mind(x,rows=1) is a matrix with one row, not a vector.  Running as.matrix(x[1,]) would return a one-column matrix, instead mind(x,rows=1) returns a one-row matrix, which is probably what you want. It also defines a function "vdim" which returns the dimension of variables and defines a dimension for vectors as c(length(x),1).
